# AI Command Center – Pending Work

## Overview
This document serves as a central reference for any AI agents that will continue development on the **Bluewud OTS** application. It lists all functions, components, and high‑level features that are **not yet completed** and provides concise guidance on what needs to be done.

## Pending Functions / Service Stubs
| File | Function / Service | Description | Suggested Next Steps |
|------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `src/services/whatsappService.js` | `sendWhatsAppMessage(orderId, templateId)` | Sends order status updates via WhatsApp Business API. | Implement API client, handle token refresh, add error handling. |
| `src/services/pushNotificationService.js` (not created) | `registerPushSubscription(userId, subscription)` | Registers web‑push subscription for real‑time alerts. | Create service, integrate with Service Worker `sw.js`, store subscriptions in backend. |
| `src/services/offlineCacheService.js` (not created) | `cacheData(key, data)` / `retrieveCachedData(key)` | Simple IndexedDB wrapper for offline support. | Implement using `idb` library, hook into data fetching layers. |
| `src/utils/dataUtils.js` | `deduplicateOrders(existing, incoming)` | Already present but needs optimisation for large batches. | Add streaming processing, unit tests, and performance benchmarks. |
| `src/utils/labelGenerator.js` | `generateLabel(order)` | Generates printable label data. | Connect to carrier APIs, add PDF generation, expose via UI. |
| `src/services/activityLogger.js` | `logActivity(action, details)` | Central activity logging. | Persist logs to backend, add log rotation, secure storage. |
| `src/services/keyboardShortcuts.js` | `registerShortcut(keyCombo, handler)` | Global keyboard shortcuts. | Ensure accessibility, conflict resolution, documentation. |

## Pending UI / Feature Work (Admin‑Friendly Roadmap Items)
These items are already reflected in the **Roadmap** page for admin visibility. No code details are included – only plain language descriptions.

- **Responsive Layout (Mobile/Tablet)** – Adapt the UI to work smoothly on phones and tablets, ensuring touch‑optimized controls and fluid grids.
- **Push Notifications** – Real‑time alerts for order status changes via web‑push, visible in the admin dashboard.
- **WhatsApp Order Updates** – Automated order status messages sent through WhatsApp Business API.
- **Predictive Analytics** – AI‑driven demand forecasting and smart carrier selection based on historical data.
- **Auto Carrier Selection** – Automatic routing of shipments to the most cost‑effective carrier.
- **Demand Forecasting** – Inventory planning using sales trends and seasonality.
- **Advanced Security** – Implement 2FA, IP whitelisting, and hardened session management.
- **Offline Support (PWA Enhancements)** – Further caching strategies, background sync for order creation when offline.

## Guidance for Future AI Agents
1. **Prioritise admin‑visible features** first – update the `futureFeatures` array in `RoadmapPage.jsx` with clear, concise descriptions (as done).  
2. **Implement service stubs** listed above before wiring them into UI components.  
3. **Write unit tests** for each new function, especially data‑handling utilities (`deduplicateOrders`, `generateLabel`).  
4. **Maintain the design aesthetic** – all new UI should follow the existing “Bluewud Dark Elite” theme with glassmorphism and invisible scrollbars.  
5. **Update `task.md`** after completing each item, moving the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`.
